LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Firmware Developer Edition

In the LEGO MINDSTORMS team we have for many years been proud providers of an open-source, easily hack-able robotics platform. With the increased Internet connectivity in the World, we see the need to increase the connection security on the EV3, to protect it from attacks over the Internet when using a Wi-Fi dongle. So, to further strengthen a secure environment for our users and still keep our open-source and easily hack-able platform promise, we will have three different editions of the Firmware for the EV3.

Firmware editions 1.09H & 1.09E are the latest releases of the official Home Edition and Education Edition Firmware. In these two editions, we have increased the security level to prevent attacks from the Internet, when a Wi-Fi dongle is plugged into the EV3. 

This increase in security will not affect the user-experiences of LEGO MINDSTORMS Apps or Software. It does however mean that these two Firmware editions are not as easy to hack anymore. Therefore, to stay true to our promise of an easily hack-able platform, a 1.09D edition called EV3 Firmware Developer Edition has been created. This is a developer version of the firmware still allowing for Telnet access with a passkey. Telnet is an advanced connection interface that allows a user to remotely access the Linux operating system on the EV3 with administrative rights.
