  Download strategy
  -----------------

  Downloading large files take time, so how to download files can be approached in 2 ways.

    1) Downloading in largest possible messages i.e. using the largest command size as
       possible (65534 bytes). if message size can be keept below 65534 bytes then all
       data could fit into the begin download command and that would be the fastest way
       to download that file. This is the fastest way to download but time is consumed
       in big chunks.

    2) Splitting up the file download into several messages i.e. one begin download and
       several continue download commands. This will increase the download time, however
       if other commands with higher priority is needed during the download these can be
       interleaved between each continue download command.
       This is the slowest way to download files, but leaves the possibility of interleave
       other commands in between the continue download messages.

    It is essential that a full message is not interrupted by other messages, that is when
    the brick has received the command size (2 first bytes of a message) ALL remaining bytes
    must be received as the following bytes, and the reply (from the brick) for that message
    has to be received before a new message can be sent and processed in the brick.


  Other download information
  --------------------------

  - File DownLoad
    - Destination filename path is relative from "lms2012/sys"
    - Destination folders are automatically created from filename path
    - First folder name must be: "apps", "prjs" or "tools" (see \ref UIdesign)
    - Second folder name in filename path must be equal to byte code executable name

  - File Upload (File read)
    - BEGIN_UPLOAD and CONTINUE_UPLOAD closes automatically the file handle when file has been uploaded
    - BEGIN_GETFILE and CONTINUE_GETFILE does not close the file handle when EOF has been reached
    - CONTINUE_GETFILE does also return the complete file size

  - Directory upload
    - LIST_FILES should work as long as list does not exceed 1014 bytes. CONTINUE_LISTFILES has NOT
      been implemented yet.

  - File handles
    - CLOSE_FILEHANDLE is partly implemented - hash is not working
